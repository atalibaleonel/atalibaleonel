I began my career in sales, driven by a passion for technology. Throughout my time in various sales roles, I won awards and honed my business skills, enabling me to view opportunities from both micro and macro perspectives.

Initially, I took courses in front-end and back-end development, but I found greater satisfaction in the business field. This shift allowed me to refine both my soft and hard skills. I firmly believe that while technical knowledge in programming, software, and hardware is crucial, understanding business and possessing strong communication skills are equally important.

My curiosity about how things work has been a constant throughout my life. At the age of 8, I played Tibia and encountered programming for the first time by exploring PHP files on a private game server. Today, I work as a data analyst and business intelligence developer.

Currently, I live in Portugal. I enjoy sports, arts, classical music, and above all, exploring new life experiences. I am beginning my studies in artificial intelligence and French.
